    I'm Adam!  I'm a curiosity-driven data scientist and Python developer.  I love a good histogram, running and the wilderness, and crafting things (with code or wood).  <br><br>
    
    Find links at the sidebar for a quick resume, contact info, and posts featuring data science and other topics of interest!  I'm in the process of updating this landing page so please bear with me! <br><br>
