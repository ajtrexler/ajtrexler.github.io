# landing page for Adam J. Trexler

A landing page with resume, contact info, and a simple blog to post code snippets and cursory explorations of data, Python, machine learning, git, all the things.  

This page was created for the [Leonid](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids/) template, for which I'm grateful to the creator [Renyuanz](https://github.com/renyuanz).
