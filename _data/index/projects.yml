  descr: "The tool to solve the infovore's dilemma!  One side-project I'm developing is a mechanism to take back some of my personal bandwidth (attention) from info overload and social media.  Maat is a prototype piece of a software that will pull emails from my inbox, say newsletters and daily updates or RSS feeds, and allow me to label sections of text as interesting or not.  This is the raw data for NLP algorithms to learn what I think is interesting, and eventually, that model will drive the output of a personally-curated set of emails"
