### How I Manage my Time

[Link](https://github.com/ajtrexler/seshat) to my github repo where I started building a life management and todo manager using Python.

But I was convinced to stick with Asana and begin note-taking (for at least some tasks) using Git.  [This is a great article.](https://zwischenzugs.com/2017/12/03/how-i-manage-my-time/)  

I'll quote the author here: 
> "the point is that all the things that impinge on my consciousness get put in here, and get out of my mind, giving me a clear head."

That should be a mantra of project and time management and productivity lit, if ever there was one.
